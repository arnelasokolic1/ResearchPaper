## Objectives:
- Investigate how modern processors like CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs contribute to the development of AI.
- Examine the philosophical debate on whether machines can truly think or if they merely simulate human behavior.
- Explore the ethical and societal implications of AI automation, particularly its potential to replace human jobs.

## Key Insights:
- While AI can simulate certain aspects of cognition, it lacks consciousness and self-awareness.
- Modern processors, especially TPUs, have significantly advanced AI capabilities, but challenges remain in achieving genuine machine cognition.
- AI is unlikely to fully replace humans in creative, empathetic, and critical thinking roles, though it may disrupt jobs in repetitive or data-driven fields.
